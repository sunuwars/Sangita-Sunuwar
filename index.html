  <p>I have always been fascinated by logical reasoning used to solve problems in coding and pixels lit up in response always excites me. I have worked in Learndirect online learning system as an administrator for 3 years. I admired the system and used to wonder and wish if I could do something like that. I have seen the web site improve and evolve delivering users’ needs and interest. Often times, the changes were the ones I wished it could be implemented there.

  <p>At home, me and my kids (aged 5 and 2 then) used to make up a lot of games (guessing games, colouring challenge etc.). Small codes written by me (guessing game, random probability), when generated random results used to amaze and entertain them.

  <p>Following my heart, I went to India to pursue my passion. I joined Analyze System as a trainee developer in Nov 2015. I have learnt various technologies that I knew nothing about before and used them to solve problems. Every day I face new challenges and problems and solving them has reinforced my can-do attitude. I strive to catering high quality, user-friendly, cost-effective solutions that bring dreams within everyone’s reach.

  <p>My husband had been serving in British Army so I had been moving with him back and forth between Brunei and UK. I have worked various interesting job roles in UK and overseas. I believe with my hard work, positive attitude and life experiences, I can bring a lot to the table.
